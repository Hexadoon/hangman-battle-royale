# Hangmang Battle Royale

An online multiplayer guessing game.

## The game

Hangman BR is a virtual take on the classic word-guessing game "Hangman". In this version, each player will select a word of specific length and category, and take turns guessing letters from their opponents' words. Players can lose in two ways: either they incorrectly guess letters from others' words, which woulc cause a body part to appear on the hangman image, or their word is deduced by the other players.
